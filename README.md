Q4.2: What challenges might you face when developing and deploying this kind of application, and how would you tackle them?

## Docker & JavaScript 3D

Q5.1: How would you containerize a Node.js application serving a web-based 3D viewer powered by Three.js?

Q5.2: What kind of considerations would you need to keep in mind when deploying this Docker container in a production environment?

## Practical Task: Generate a 3D Pyramid in Blender using Python

The goal of this task is to write a Python script that creates a 3D pyramid in Blender. The pyramid should have a square base with four triangular sides that meet at a single point (the apex). 

The following steps outline the process, and a sample code snippet is provided to guide you.

1. **Clear the existing mesh objects in Blender**. 

2. **Create a new mesh and an object to link it with**. 

3. **Define the vertices and faces of the pyramid**. 

4. **Update the mesh with pyramid data**.

5. **Center the pyramid in the scene**. 

6. **Export the pyramid model in GLTF format**. 

Please note, this script creates a pyramid with a fixed size and shape. In a real task, you might want to add parameters to control the size, proportions, and orientation of the pyramid, and to place it at different locations in the scene.

# MORE HINTS FOR THE TASKS


**Q4.1 HINT : Let me elaborate the quetion with all the hints. Imagine you're creating a pipeline to automatically generate 3D models in Blender using Python scripts. Then, you will display these models on a web interface served by Flask. Finally, the whole application runs in a Docker environment. How would you structure this pipeline?**

**Blender and Python:**

You can use Python scripting within Blender to create or modify 3D models:

```python
import bpy

# Clear all mesh objects
bpy.ops.object.select_by_type(type='MESH')
bpy.ops.object.delete()

# Create a new cube
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add()
```

This script can be run from the command line:

```bash
blender --background --python my_script.py
```

**Flask & Three.js:**

After creating your model, you'll export it from Blender in a format readable by Three.js (such as `.glb` or `.gltf`). You'll then create a simple Flask application to serve your web page:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

The `index.html` should include your Three.js code to load and display the 3D model:

```html
<!-- Include Three.js library -->
<script src="https://threejs.org/build/three.js"></script>

<script>
var scene = new THREE.Scene();
var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Load your 3D model
var loader = new THREE.GLTFLoader();
loader.load('/path_to_your_model.gltf', function(gltf){
  scene.add(gltf.scene);
}, undefined, function(error){
  console.error(error);
});

// Render the scene
var animate = function () {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
};

animate();
</script>
```

**Docker:**

Finally, you'll need to set up a Docker container for your Flask application. Here's a basic Dockerfile for a Flask app:

```Dockerfile
# Use Python 3.7 image
FROM python:3.7-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the dependencies file to the working directory
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install any dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the content of the local src directory to the working directory
COPY src/ .

# Specify the command to run on container start
CMD [ "python", "./app.py" ]
```

The `requirements.txt` should contain Flask, along with any other Python packages your app needs.

To build and run your Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 -d my-app
```

This will start your application in a new Docker container, and it will be accessible at `localhost:5000` in your web browser.

Again, this is a basic overview. Each of these steps can be more complex depending on your specific needs and setup. For instance, you may need to handle errors, manage dependencies, and structure your code in a way that's maintainable and scalable. You also have to consider data flow between each step of the process, how to handle updates to the 3D models, and how to manage the Docker containers

# Python Blender Task: Generate a 3D Pyramid

The goal of this task is to write a Python script that creates a 3D pyramid in Blender. The pyramid should have a square base with four triangular sides that meet at a single point (the apex).

Below are the steps and some sample code to guide you through the task.

## Steps

1. **Clear the existing mesh objects in Blender**

   We start with a clean canvas by deleting all existing mesh objects.

2. **Create a new mesh and an object to link it with**

   A new mesh for the pyramid and an object to link it to the scene are created.

3. **Define the vertices and faces of the pyramid**

   Vertices for the base and the apex of the pyramid, and faces for the triangular sides are defined.

4. **Update the mesh with pyramid data**

   The mesh object is updated with the vertices and faces of the pyramid.

5. **Center the pyramid in the scene**

   The pyramid is positioned at the center of the scene.

6. **Export the pyramid model**

   The pyramid model is exported in GLTF format, which can be loaded into a Three.js scene.

## Sample Code

```python
import bpy

# Clear all mesh objects
bpy.ops.object.select_by_type(type='MESH')
bpy.ops.object.delete()

# Create a new mesh object
mesh = bpy.data.meshes.new(name="PyramidMesh")
obj = bpy.data.objects.new("Pyramid", mesh)

# Link the object to the scene
scene = bpy.context.scene
scene.collection.objects.link(obj)

# Create a pyramid
verts = [(1, 1, 0), (1, -1, 0), (-1, -1, 0), (-1, 1, 0), (0, 0, 2)]  # 5 vertices
faces = [(0, 1, 4), (1, 2, 4), (2, 3, 4), (3, 0, 4)]  # 4 faces

# Update the mesh with the new data
mesh.from_pydata(verts, [], faces)

# Center the pyramid in the scene
obj.location = (0, 0, 0)

# Update the scene
bpy.context.view_layer.update()

# Export the model in GLTF format
bpy.ops.export_scene.gltf(filepath="/path/to/your/file.gltf")
```

Remember, this script creates a pyramid with a fixed size and shape. In a real task, you might want to add parameters to control the size, proportions, and orientation of the pyramid, and to place it at different locations in the scene.

## Testing

To test your script, you can run it from the command line using:

```bash
blender --background --python your_script.py
```

You should find your exported `.gltf` file at the location you specified.

Good luck!
